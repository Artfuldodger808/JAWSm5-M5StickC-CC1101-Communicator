# JAWSm5-M5StickC-CC1101-Communicator
This project is completed in collaboration with gpt3.5 . I'm not great at Arduino coding so I'm trying to develop a project with the help of AI , if anyone wants to contribute or critique I would be eternally grateful for the help âœŒ. I have little to no idea how to expand on this except to build extra functions like built in known frequencies of commonly used wavelengths, at this time I'm pretty certain this code is unusable but I'm looking to develop a better understanding as well as developing a shield Pcb to plug into the M5stick C plus (I couldn't afford a flipperzero)
